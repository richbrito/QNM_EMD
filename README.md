# Quasinormal modes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton
These notebooks contain detailed derivations and calculations
of perturbations of black hole solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton.


* EQS_derivation.nb - Notebook with derivations of the perturbed equations of motion. The final equations are listed in the notebook EQS_list.nb.

* EQS_list.nb - Notebook with a list of the final perturbed equations of motion derived in the notebook EQS_derivation.nb.

* QNM_plots.nb - Collection of plots with QNM frequencies


These notebooks are developed and maintained by Costantino Pacilio and Richard Brito. Please, report any issues to
