# Quasinormal modes of weakly charged Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes

These notebooks were developed to obtain the results in https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09081. They contain detailed derivations and calculations
of perturbations of black hole solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton.


* EQS_derivation.nb - Notebook with derivations of the perturbed equations of motion. The final equations are listed in the notebook EQS_list.nb.

* EQS_list.nb - Notebook with a list of the final perturbed equations of motion derived in the notebook EQS_derivation.nb.

* QNM_plots.nb - Collection of plots with QNM frequencies
