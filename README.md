# Quasinormal modes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton
These notebooks contain detailed derivations and calculations
of perturbations of black hole solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton.


"EQS_derivation.nb" = In this notebook we derive the perturbed equations of motion. The final equations are listed in the notebook "EQS_list.nb".

"EQS_list.nb" = In this notebook we provide a list of the perturbed equations of motion derived in the notebook "EQS_derivation.nb".

"QNM_plots.nb" = Collection of the QNMs with plots and mutual-comparisons plots
